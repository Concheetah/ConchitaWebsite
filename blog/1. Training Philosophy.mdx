I started building soft skill trainings after I graduated from a training for trainers from Youth Trainers Academy (https://www.youthtrainersacademy.com/). The event lasted for 10 days, but made changes to me for a lifetime. I attended the version from 2017.
I learned there how to design training sessions according to educational theory. 
We mostly used the Experiential Learning theory from Kolb. From that theory an useful tool is developed called 4MAT. 
I still use that today. It is handy to make sure that all learning styles are included in the training.

Another part of theory was debriefing. That was completely new to me: what did the word mean? It is basically to
make sure that participants learn from the session. To reflect on the exercises we did and to see what they will
take out of it. We used a framework called the 4Fs to make sure we reflected on everything - Facts, Feelings, Findings, Future.
Facts is to see what actually happened. Feelings are focusing on the experience of the participant. Findings are the learning
insights of the participant. Future
